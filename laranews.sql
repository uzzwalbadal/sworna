They noted among other things that Chinese officials are still reluctant to share some raw data, citing concerns over patient confidentiality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, WHO sent a team of experts to Wuhan, where the first human COVID-19 cases were detected in December 2019, to probe what might have triggered the pandemic now blamed for nearly 4.5 million deaths worldwide, with more than 10,000 people a day succumbing despite more than 5 billion doses of vaccine administered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their analysis, published in March, the WHO team concluded the virus probably jumped to humans from animals, and they described the possibility of a laboratory leak as &quot;extremely unlikely.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the WHO experts said their report was intended only as a first step and added, &quot;The window of opportunity for conducting this crucial inquiry is closing fast: any delay will render some of the studies biologically impossible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, they said, &quot;Antibodies wane, so collecting further samples and testing people who might have been exposed before December 2019 will yield diminishing returns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China said Wednesday that officials should &quot;concentrate on other possible avenues that may help trace the origin&quot; of COVID-19 and suggested studies should be pursued in other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fu Cong, a director-general in China&#39;s Foreign Ministry, agreed it is a &quot;pity&quot; the search for COVID-19&#39;s origins has stalled but said it wasn&#39;t China&#39;s fault. &quot;China has always supported and will continue to participate in the science-based origin tracing efforts,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He accused the US of &quot;hyping the lab leak theory&quot; and trying to shift the blame onto China, and implied the coronavirus might be linked to high-level American research labs, suggesting the United States invite WHO to investigate some of its installations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marion Koopmans and her WHO-recruited colleagues listed a number of priorities for further research, including conducting wider antibody surveys that might identify places where COVID-19 was spreading undetected, both in China and beyond, testing wild bats and farm-raised animals as potential reservoirs of the virus, and investigating any credible new leads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some other scientists fear the best opportunities to collect samples might have been missed during the first few weeks after some of the earliest human cases appeared linked to a Wuhan seafood market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese researchers collected hundreds of environmental samples immediately after the coronavirus was found, but it is unclear how many people or animals were tested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Once you have wildlife traders shifting over to other kinds of employment because they&#39;re worried about whether they&#39;ll be able to do this anymore, that window starts to close,&quot; said Maciej Boni, a Pennsylvania State University biology professor who has studied virus origins and was not part of the WHO team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Boni said scientists might be able to pinpoint COVID-19&#39;s animal source by hunting for closely related viruses in species like raccoon dogs, mink or ground squirrels. But he said it could take about five years to do the kind of extensive studies necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The search for COVID-19&#39;s origins has become a bitter source of dispute between the US and China, with increasing numbers of American experts calling for the two Wuhan laboratories close to the seafood market to be investigated, something China has flatly rejected and branded &quot;scapegoating.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden in May ordered a 90-day review by US intelligence agencies of both the animal-to-human hypothesis and the lab leak theory.

He was 80.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernard Doherty said Tuesday that Watts &quot;passed away peacefully in a London hospital earlier today surrounded by his family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Charlie was a cherished husband, father and grandfather and also as a member of The Rolling Stones one of the greatest drummers of his generation,&quot; Doherty said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts had announced he would not tour with the Stones in 2021 because of an undefined health issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quiet, elegantly dressed Watts was often ranked with Keith Moon, Ginger Baker and a handful of others as a premier rock drummer, respected worldwide for his muscular, swinging style as the Stones rose from their scruffy beginnings to international superstardom. He joined the band early in 1963 and remained for nearly 60 years, ranked just behind Mick Jagger and Keith Richards as the group&#39;s longest lasting and most essential member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts stayed on, and largely held himself apart, through the drug abuse, creative clashes and ego wars that helped kill founding member Brian Jones, drove bassist Bill Wyman and Jones&#39; replacement Mick Taylor to quit and otherwise made being in the Stones a most exhausting job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"FILE - Members of the Rolling Stones, from left, Charlie Watts, Ron Wood, Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger appear at a party celebrating the opening of their film \" src=\"https://cdn.premiumread.com/web30/storage/thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2021/08/25/w800/8208.jpg.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FILE - Members of the Rolling Stones, from left, Charlie Watts, Ron Wood, Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger appear at a party celebrating the opening of their film &quot;Let&#39;s Spend The Night Together,&quot; in New York on Jan. 18, 1983. Photo: Carlos Rene Perez/AP/File</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A classic Stones song like &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Start Me Up&quot; often began with a hard guitar riff from Richards, with Watts following closely behind, and Wyman, as the bassist liked to say, &quot;fattening the sound.&quot; Watts&#39; speed, power and time keeping were never better showcased than during the concert documentary, &quot;Shine a Light,&quot; when director Martin Scorsese filmed &quot;Jumpin&#39; Jack Flash&quot; from where he drummed toward the back of the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stones began, Watts said, &quot;as white blokes from England playing Black American music&quot; but quickly evolved their own distinctive sound. Watts was a jazz drummer in his early years and never lost his affinity for the music he first loved, heading his own jazz band and taking on numerous other side projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had his eccentricities - Watts liked to collect cars even though he didn&#39;t drive and would simply sit in them in his garage. But he was a steadying influence on stage and off as the Stones defied all expectations by rocking well into their 70s, decades longer than their old rivals the Beatles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts didn&#39;t care for flashy solos or attention of any kind, but with Wyman and Richards forged some of rock&#39;s deepest grooves on &quot;Honky Tonk Women,&quot; &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and other songs. The drummer adapted well to everything from the disco of &quot;Miss You&quot; to the jazzy &quot;Can&#39;t You Hear Me Knocking&quot; and the dreamy ballad &quot;Moonlight Mile.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jagger and Richards at times seemed to agree on little else besides their admiration of Watts, both as a man and a musician. Richards called Watts &quot;the key&quot; and often joked that their affinity was so strong that on stage he&#39;d sometimes try to rattle Watts by suddenly changing the beat - only to have Watts change it right back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also had an impact on the Rolling Stones that extended beyond drumming. He worked with Jagger on the ever more spectacular stage designs for the group&#39;s tours. He also provided illustrations for the back cover of the acclaimed 1967 album &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; and inadvertently gave the record its title. When he asked Stones manager Andrew Oldham what the album would be called, Oldham responded &quot;Between the buttons,&quot; meaning undecided. Watts thought that &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; was the actual name and included it in his artwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the world, he was a rock star. But Watts often said that the actual experience was draining and unpleasant, and even frightening. &quot;Girls chasing you down the street, screaming ... horrible!... I hated it,&quot; he told The Guardian newspaper in an interview. In another interview, he described the drumming life as a &quot;cross between being an athlete and a total nervous wreck.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts found refuge from the rock life, marrying Shirley Ann Shepherd in 1964 and having a daughter, Seraphina, soon after. While other famous rock marriages crumbled, theirs held. Jagger and Richards could only envy their bandmate&#39;s indifference to stardom and relative contentment in his private life, which included happily tending horses on a rural estate in Devon, England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Author Philip Norman, who has written extensively about the Rolling Stones, said Watts lived &quot;in constant hope of being allowed to catch the next plane home.&quot; On tour, he made a point of drawing each hotel room he stayed in, a way of marking time until he could return to his family. He said little about playing the same songs for more than 40 years as the Stones recycled their classics. But he did branch out far beyond &quot;Satisfaction&quot; and &quot;Jumpin&#39; Jack Flash&quot; by assembling and performing with jazz bands in the second half of his career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charles Robert Watts, son of a truck driver and a homemaker, was born in Neasden, London, on June 2, 1941. From childhood, he was passionate about music - jazz in particular. He fell in love with the drums after hearing Chico Hamilton, and taught himself to play by listening to records by Johnny Dodds, Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington and other jazz giants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He worked for a London advertising firm after he attended London&#39;s Harrow Art College and played drums in his spare time. London was home to a blues and jazz revival in the early 1960s, with Jagger, Richards and Eric Clapton among the future superstars getting their start. Watts&#39; career took off after he played with Alexis Korner&#39;s Blues Incorporated, for whom Jagger also performed, and was encouraged by Korner to join the Stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts wasn&#39;t a rock music fan at first and remembered being guided by Richards and Brian Jones as he absorbed blues and rock records, notably the music of bluesman Jimmy Reed. He said the band could trace its roots to a brief period when he had lost his job and shared an apartment with Jagger and Richards because he could live there rent-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Keith Richards taught me rock and roll,&quot; Watts said. &quot;We&#39;d have nothing to do all day and we&#39;d play these records over and over again. I learned to love Muddy Waters. Keith turned me on to how good Elvis Presley was, and I&#39;d always hated Elvis up &#39;til then.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts was the final man to join the Stones; the band had searched for months to find a permanent drummer and feared Watts was too accomplished for them. Richards recalled the band wanting him so badly to join that members cut down on expenses so they could afford to pay Watts a proper salary. Watts said he believed at first the band would be lucky to last a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every band I&#39;d ever been in had lasted a week,&quot; he said. &quot;I always thought the Stones would last a week, then a fortnight, and then suddenly, it&#39;s 30 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For much of his career, Watts resisted the excesses of his bandmates, but he fell into heroin addiction in the mid-1980s. He would credit his stable relationship with his wife for getting him off drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was warring with myself at that time,&quot; he told Rolling Stone magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his financial future secure because of the Stones&#39; status as one of the world&#39;s most popular live bands, Watts was able to indulge his passion for jazz by putting together some of the most talented musicians in Britain for a series of recordings and performances. They typically played during the long breaks between Stones tours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His first jazz record, the 1986 &quot;Live at Fulham Town Hall,&quot; was recorded by the Charlie Watts Orchestra. Others by the Charlie Watts Quintet followed, and he expanded that group into the Charlie Watts and the Tentet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts was an acclaimed jazz bandleader when he was stricken with throat cancer in 2004. He received extensive treatment and made a full recovery. His return to health allowed him to resume touring with both the Stones and his jazz band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By then, the young man who had worn his brown hair down to his shoulders in the late 1960s had evolved into a craggy, white-haired, impeccably dressed senior statesman of rock. Getting Watts to talk about his place in rock history was almost impossible, but he seemed to enjoy talking about fashion. It was not unusual to see him attired in a custom-made suit and polka dot tie while his bandmates wore jeans and T-shirts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the tumultuous, extremely competitive world of rock and roll, Watts seemed to make few enemies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It all seems to boil down to a certain quality which is as rare as hen&#39;s teeth in the music business, but which Charlie Watts is perceived to have in abundance. In a word, decency,&quot; columnist Barbara Ellen wrote after interviewing Watts in 2000. &quot;You&#39;ve got to hand it to a ... man who&#39;s played with the world&#39;s most influential rock &#39;n&#39; roll band ... and stayed happily married to his wife, Shirley ... A man who, moreover, remains resolutely determined not to take his elevated position too seriously.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts is survived by his wife Shirley, sister Linda, daughter Seraphina and granddaughter Charlotte.</p>', '3', '2109261124588207.jpg.webp', 'publish', 0, '2021-09-26 05:39:58', NULL),
